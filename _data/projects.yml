    This was my final project for the Rails bootcamp, and I keep improving it whenever I have time. On this project, I started experimenting with
    Rails' Hotwire stack (Turbo + Stimulus.js) and am just scratching the surface. To be continued!

- name: Portfolio
  technologies: [HTML, CSS, Jekyll]
  description: The portfolio site that you are looking at. Nothing fancy, but my first shot at static site generators. I like the possibility
    to separate presentation and data, so it should be easy to extend the information in the future. I used a minimalist approach without
    any frameworks.
